# 👋 Hi, I’m Michel.

I've been coding ever since I can remember—if there's a language, I've probably tinkered with it! My main toolkit features TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java (with occasional forays into C#, C++, and Rust). I’m always on the hunt for new frameworks, tools, and creative coding challenges.

I love working with data—handling, processing, and bringing it to life through visualization. My journey spans building scalable web apps, architecting backend services, developing complex system integrations, and creating robust APIs. I’ve crafted ERP and CRM solutions for all kinds of industries, and I know my way around regulatory compliance.

But lately, my biggest adventure is diving deep into AI and blockchain—exploring, experimenting, and building at the frontier where intelligence meets decentralization. It’s an exciting time and my favorite playground for innovation.
